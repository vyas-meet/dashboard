A personalised dashboard extension that makes use of the openweathermap weather API & the unsplash image API.

The dashboard also has a mini-to-do list that saves tasks to the local storage. 

While the page is intended to be used as an extension for desktops, it's responsive in nature. It should work well on all screen sizes.

Everything is coded in vanilla CSS and JavaScript.
